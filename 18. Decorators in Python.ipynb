    " \n",
    " * __Decorators provides a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions.__\n",
    " * __By definition, a decorators is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the the latter function without explicitly modifying it.__\n",
    " * __A decorator in Python is a function that takes another functions as its argument, and returns yet another function.__\n",
    " * __Decorators can be extremely useful as they allow the extension of an existing function,without any modification to the original function source code.__\n",
    " * __In Fact, there are two types of decorators in Python including class decorators and function decorators.__\n",
    " * __In application, decorators are majorly used in creating middle layer in the backend, it performs task like token authentication, validation, image compression and many more.__\n",
